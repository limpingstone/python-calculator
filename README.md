# python-calculator
A basic scientific calculator powered by python featuring polynomial functions, exponential functions, trigonometric functions, and their derivatives. The backend is written in python 3.6 and the GUI for the calculator is built from wxPython 4.0.3 

Note that the calculator only supports one variable throughout the program, and the featured functions include the sine, cosine, and exponential function. 

The calculator functionality can be tested using the run_test.py script that provides some examples of creating the operand objects.

wxPython is required to run the GUI from graphics.py (still in development)
To install wxPython, type in the command line with provided sudo privilege: 
```
$ sudo pip install wxPython==4.0.3
```

To launch the GUI, type in the command: 
```
$ cd python-container
$ python3 graphics.py
```
